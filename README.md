This repo contains a microservice implementation of the shortest path algorithm using Djikstra and realtion DB ie. DERBY and spring data JPA with hibernate for data persistence. This repo also contains soap and rest implemenation for querying the shortest paths. The allowed shortest paths source and destination are currently given below as:
A
B
C
D
E
F
G
H
I
J
K
L
M
N
O
P
Q
R
S
T
U
V
W
X
Y
Z
A'
B'
C'
D'
E'
F'
G'
H'
I'
J'
K'
The oupput will be a "->" separated series of nodes starting at source and ending at destination For Eg. A->D-M.
